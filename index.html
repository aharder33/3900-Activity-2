            Hello everyone! My name is Abie Harder. I am an MBA/MIS student at UNO. I just started the MIS program last semester and am excited to get into the bulk of the program. I work at NCITE (National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center) as a graduate assistant. I also work at HDR on the ERP team in their technology department. In my freetime, I like to read, snowboard, and hang out with my two golden retrievers (linked below).
